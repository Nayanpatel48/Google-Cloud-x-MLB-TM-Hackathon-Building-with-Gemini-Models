# Google-Cloud-x-MLB-TM-Hackathon-Building-with-Gemini-Models
``This is a DEVPOST hackathon project built by me on feb 1 2025. winter break.``

- The challenge that i have been working on: **Build a system that allows fans to select team(s), player(s), and other parts of the baseball experience and subsequently receive relevant summary audio, video and/or text digests on a regular cadence to stay up on the latest highlights and commentary related to the fanâ€™s selection. Ensure your solution supports fans who speak English, Spanish, and Japanese. MLB information, including audio, video and text for a project in this category can be found here: https://github.com/MajorLeagueBaseball/google-cloud-mlb-hackathon.***

## Learnings:

### 1. OnChange, value prop : 

```javaScript 
<input
  value={email}
  onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
/>
```
- `value={email}`: This is the crucial part that makes the input controlled.  It binds the value of the input field to the `email` variable in your component's state.  This means:
- The input field will always display the value that is stored in the `email` state variable.
- If you change the `email` state (using `setEmail`), the input field will automatically update to reflect the new value.

- Whenever the user types something into the input field, the `onChange` event is triggered.  The arrow function is executed, which takes the current value of the input field (`e.target.value`) and uses the `setEmail` function to update the `email` state variable in your React component.  This, in turn, causes React to re-render the component, reflecting the updated value in the input field (and anywhere else you might be using the `email` state).
