``This is a DEVPOST hackathon project built by me on feb 1 2025. winter break.``

- The challenge that i have been working on: **Build a system that allows fans to select team(s), player(s), and other parts of the baseball experience and subsequently receive relevant summary audio, video and/or text digests on a regular cadence to stay up on the latest highlights and commentary related to the fanâ€™s selection. Ensure your solution supports fans who speak English, Spanish, and Japanese. MLB information, including audio, video and text for a project in this category can be found here: https://github.com/MajorLeagueBaseball/google-cloud-mlb-hackathon.***
