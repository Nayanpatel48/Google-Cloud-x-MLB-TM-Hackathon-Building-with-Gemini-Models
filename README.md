# Google-Cloud-x-MLB-TM-Hackathon-Building-with-Gemini-Models
``This is a DEVPOST hackathon project built by me on feb 1 2025. winter break.``

- The challenge that i have been working on: **Build a system that allows fans to select team(s), player(s), and other parts of the baseball experience and subsequently receive relevant summary audio, video and/or text digests on a regular cadence to stay up on the latest highlights and commentary related to the fanâ€™s selection. Ensure your solution supports fans who speak English, Spanish, and Japanese. MLB information, including audio, video and text for a project in this category can be found here: https://github.com/MajorLeagueBaseball/google-cloud-mlb-hackathon.***

### Login: 


## Learnings:

### 1. *OnChange={}*, *value={}* prop for html elements such as input, buttons etc: 

```javaScript 
<input
  value={email}
  onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
/>
```
- `value={email}`: This is the crucial part that makes the input controlled.  It binds the value of the input field to the `email` variable in your component's state.  This means:
- The input field will always display the value that is stored in the `email` state variable.
- If you change the `email` state (using `setEmail`), the input field will automatically update to reflect the new value.

- Whenever the user types something into the input field, the `onChange` event is triggered.  The arrow function is executed, which takes the current value of the input field (`e.target.value`) and uses the `setEmail` function to update the `email` state variable in your React component.  This, in turn, causes React to re-render the component, reflecting the updated value in the input field (and anywhere else you might be using the `email` state).

### 2. <Link/> tag: 

```javaScript
<Link to="/register">
  Sign up
</Link>
```

- `<Link ... >`: This is the JSX syntax for a link component, specifically the `Link` component from `react-router-dom`.  It's used for navigation within your React application.  It's preferred over regular `<a>`tags for internal links because it prevents a **full page reload** , making navigation faster and smoother.

### 3. *onSubmit* prop:

```javaScript
  <form className="space-y-4 md:space-y-6" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
```

- `onSubmit={handleSubmit}`: This is the most important part for form handling in React.  It's an event handler that's called when the form is submitted (e.g., when the user clicks a submit button).

- `onSubmit`: This is a standard React event handler for forms.

- `{handleSubmit}`: This is a reference to a function in your React component.  When the form is submitted, this function will be executed.

### 4. async await asynchronous operations: 

```javaScript
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setError(null);

    try {
      await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);
      console.log("User logged in successfully!");
      // Redirect after successful login
      navigate("/"); // Or whatever route you want to redirect to
    } catch (error) {
      setError(error.message);
      console.error("Error logging in:", error);
    }
  };
```

- `const handleSubmit = async (e) => { ... };`: This defines an asynchronous function called `handleSubmit`. The `async` keyword allows you to use `await` inside the function, which makes asynchronous code easier to read and write. The function takes an event object `e` as an argument (common for form submissions).

- `e.preventDefault();`: This line prevents the default form submission behavior.  In HTML forms, clicking the submit button typically causes a *full page reload*.  `e.preventDefault()` stops this from happening, allowing you to handle the form submission with JavaScript (in this case, Firebase authentication).

- `setError(null);`: This line sets the error state variable to `null`.  This is likely used to clear any previous `error` messages that might be displayed to the user.  It's a good practice to clear errors before attempting a new submission.

- `try { ... } catch (error) { ... }`: This is a `try...catch` block.  It's used for error handling.  The code inside the `try` block is the code that might throw an error (in this case, the Firebase sign-in).  If an error occurs, the code inside the catch block is executed.

- `await signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password);`: This is the core of the login process.
`signInWithEmailAndPassword()` is a function provided by the Firebase Authentication library. It attempts to sign in a user using their email and password.

- `auth` is your Firebase authentication instance. `email` and `password` are the user's email and password, respectively. These are likely stored in state variables in your React component and updated as the user types in the input fields.

- `await` is used because `signInWithEmailAndPassword()` returns a Promise (an object that represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation.). `await` pauses the execution of the `handleSubmit` function until the Promise resolves (either the sign-in is successful or it fails).

- `console.log("User logged in successfully!");`: If the sign-in is successful, this line logs a success message to the console.

- `navigate("/");`: This line uses the navigate function (likely from `react-router-dom`) to redirect the user to the root path `("/")` after a successful login.  You can replace `"/"` with any route you want to redirect to.

- `catch (error) { ... }`: If `signInWithEmailAndPassword()` throws an `error` (e.g., incorrect email or password), the code inside the catch block is executed.

- `setError(error.message);`: This line sets the error state variable to the error message from the Firebase error object.  This allows you to display the error message to the user in your UI.

- `console.error("Error logging in:", error);`: This line logs the error to the console for debugging purposes.

### 5. Proises in javaScript:

- It is an object that represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

- **States of a Promise:**

- A Promise can be in one of three states:

- `Pending`: The initial state.  The asynchronous operation is still in progress.  You don't know the result yet.

- `Fulfilled (Resolved)`: The operation completed successfully.  The Promise has a value (the result of the operation).

- `Rejected`: The operation failed.  The Promise has a reason for the failure (an error).

### 6. onClick (React):

```javaScript
  <button onClick={myFunction}>Click Me</button>  // myFunction is a function
```

- Executes the `myFunction` when clicked
